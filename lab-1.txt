1.Basic theory on class and object,definintion and example.

  Class is a user defined datatype which consists of data and functions tied together in a single unit.
  An objest is an instance or variable of class.
  Example:
  -Multiply twon numbers and display then using concept of class
   #include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class add {
int a,b;
public:
    void set(){
    cout<<"Enter two numbers";
    cin>>a>>b;
    }
    void display(){
    cout<<Result is<<a+b;
    }
};
int main(){
add A1;
A1.set();
A1.display();
return 0;

}


2.How to create a class and object??

-Creation of class;
  class classname{
    Access specifier    //can be public,private or protected
    Data members       //variables to be used
    member functions  //Methods to access data members
    };                //class name ends with a semicolon 
 
-Creation of objects
  classname objectname;     


3.How to access data members and functions of class using objects??
  ANS:
  The data members and member functions of class can be accessed using the dot(‘.’) operator with the object.
   For example if the name of object is obj and you want to access the member function with the name printName() then you will have to write obj.printName() .


4.Analyze the following problem,determine its data members and functions and create a class.
  a.Find the simple intrest.
  #include<iostream>

using namespace std;

class Interest{
float p,t,r;
public:
    void set(){
    cout<<"Enter p,t,r??";
    cin>>p>>t>>r;
    }
    float getresult(){
    return p*t*r/100;
    }
};
int main(){
float I;
Interest obj;
obj.set();
I=obj.getresult();
cout<<The simple interest is<<I;

}
